description: Apply when creating the main page or any critical web element that requires strong technical SEO, using semantic HTML, metadata, and SSR/SSG for crawlable, optimized content.
---

- Use semantic HTML structure (`<h1>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) for clarity and accessibility.
- Ensure only one `<h1>` per page, with logical heading hierarchy (`<h2>`, `<h3>`).
- Provide accurate metadata (`title`, `meta description`, `og:tags`, `twitter:cards`) for search and social previews.
- Use descriptive, SEO-friendly URLs and ensure proper `<link rel="canonical">` tags.
- Implement SSR or SSG so primary content is crawlable and indexable.
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (fast loading, responsive, stable layout).
- Include alt text for images and accessible labels for interactive elements.
- Ensure internal linking and navigation are crawlable by search engines.
