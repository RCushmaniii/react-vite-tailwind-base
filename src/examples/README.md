# Example Components

This directory contains example components and utilities that demonstrate how to use the template's features. These files are meant to be:

1. **Educational** - They show best practices and patterns to follow
2. **Removable** - You can safely delete this directory when starting your own project
3. **Self-contained** - Examples don't affect the core functionality of the template

## What's Included

- Example components showing Tailwind styling patterns
- MSW API mocking examples
- TypeScript type usage examples

## How to Use

Study these examples to understand the project structure and conventions, then either:

1. Modify them to fit your needs, or
2. Remove them completely with `pnpm init:template --clean`

When creating your own components, you can use these as reference but place your actual project files in the appropriate directories outside of `/examples`.
